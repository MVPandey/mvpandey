## Hey there! 👋 I'm Manav

🤖 **Senior Research Engineer** @ American Express | Building the future of agentic AI, one search tree at a time

### 🧠 What I'm obsessed with
- **Search + LLMs = Magic** ✨ Currently using MCTS to teach AI emotional intelligence through self-play
- **Small models, big brains** 🐜 Why use a 70B model when a 7B model with clever orchestration and a whole host of tools might work better?
- **Agentic systems that actually ship** 🚀 Built multi-agent frameworks serving thousands

### 🔬 Current experiments
- 🎯 Monte Carlo Tree Search for generating RL training data
- 🔍 Distilling large models into lean, mean, reasoning machines
- 🛠️ MCP servers that turn academic papers into production code
- 🌳 Teaching AI to explore conversation trees and find optimal paths

### 💻 Tech stack
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, C++ | **ML:** PyTorch, vLLM, TensorFlow | **Orchestration:** LangGraph, MCP, FastAPI

### 🎓 Fun facts
- Told by a professor to avoid NLP in 2021 (best advice I never took 😄)
- Firm believer that search algorithms + tool use = AGI-lite

### 🚀 Featured Project
**[Conversational Analysis Engine](link-to-CAE)** - MCTS meets LLMs to optimize human conversations. Because sometimes the best response isn't the first one you think of.
